title: "Assessing the risk of contamination from hazardous sites due to flooding in North Carolina low-socioeconomic communities"  
subtitle: "https://github.com/tristen0708/EJ_Project"
author: "Tristen Townsend"
abstract: "It is well known that hazardous waste sites tend to be more frequently sited in low-income communities, particularly communities of color. Proximity to hazardous waste sites have potential to create health risks, especially if communities are in regions more likely to be prone to flooding or extreme precipitation. This analysis serves to understand whether risks might exist for low-income communities in North Carolina. The number and type of sites in various counties has been analyzed in order to see if minority communities are more at risk."

# Research Question and Rationale

There is significant research that indicates hazardous waste sites, especially those listed on the National Priorities List as a Superfund site, are disproportionately located in communities of color or low socioeconomic status (Burwell-Naney et al., 2013; Kramar, Anderson, Hilfer, Branden, Gutrich, 2018). In North Carolina, recent hurricanes have resulted in serious flooding in many parts of the state, creating concern as to whether Superfund sites and other hazardous waste sites were breached and might pose health effects to local communities. Given that natural disasters such as hurricanes and increased flooding is expect in North Carolina, it is important to understand if risks related to hazardous waste sites and flooding are posted to minority communities, as they tend to be low-capacity and less resilient to disasters. This information could be used by environmental justice leaders to advocate for policy changes or the implementation of safeguards to be put in place.

During this analysis, I am interested in seeing if the number of hazardous waste sites is significantly greater in areas with a large percent of minority resident or a large amount of those in poverty. Additionally, for the areas with the highest site counts, I would like to see if they are at risk for flood events based on peak stage values. Poverty and race data by county will be used, as well as site data and peak stage data.

# Dataset Information

I am using multiple datasets to answer my research question. I have downloaded geospatial data on hazardous waste site locations from North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. I have downloaded data with information about poverty and race from the U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) Program and (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018) and from the NC Budget and Management LINC data retrievel tool. Furthermore, I've obtained peak stage data for a few counties in North Carolina over that past five years from the U.S. Geological Survey.


```{r table}
Poverty_NC <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/NC_Poverty_processed.csv")
Race <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/LINC_RaceData_2010.csv")
Peak.Stage <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/FilteredPeaks.csv")

# Exploratory Data Analysis and Wrangling

Race <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/LINC_RaceData_2010.csv")
Peak.Stage <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/FilteredPeaks.csv") 

Peak.Stage_processed <- Peak.Stage %>% select("county", "latitude_dd",
    "longitude_dd", "vdatum", "peak_date", "peak_stage")

Race1 <- mutate(Race, WhitePerc = Race$White/Race$Total.Pop)

Race3 <- mutate(Race2, NativePerc = Race$Native/Race$Total.Pop)
Race4 <- mutate(Race3, AsianPerc = Race$Asian/Race$Total.Pop)
Race5 <- mutate(Race4, HispanicPerc = Race$Hispanic/Race$Total.Pop)
Race6 <- mutate(Race5, OtherPerc = Race$Other/Race$Total.Pop)
Race7 <- mutate(Race6, Haw_PacIsPerc = Race$Haw_PacIs/Race$Total.Pop)
Race8 <- mutate(Race7, TwoPerc = Race$Two/Race$Total.Pop)
Race_Processed <- mutate(Race8, MinorityPerc = (Race$Black + 
    Race$Native + Race$Asian + Race$Hispanic + Race$Other + 
    Race$Haw_PacIs + Race$Two)/Race$Total.Pop)

#Explore race and poverty data
shapiro.test(Race_Processed$MinorityPerc) #p-value = 0.0005985
shapiro.test(Poverty_NC$Poverty_Percent_allages) #p-value 0.01881 

#From the output, both p-values are < 0.05 implying that the distribution 
#of the data are significantly different from normal distribution. 
#In other words, we cannot assume the normality for either data sets.

Peak.Stage_avg <- Peak.Stage_processed %>% 
  group_by(county) %>%
  summarise(yearly_average = mean(peak_stage))
  
shapiro.test(Peak.Stage_avg$yearly_average) #p-value = 0.288 normal!
#From the output, the p-value is < 0.05 implying that the distribution

# Summary and Conclusions
<Summarize your major findings from your analyses. What conclusions do you draw from your findings? Make sure to apply this to a broader application for the research question you have answered.>

Based on my performed analysis, there is no significant difference in the number of hazardous waste sites that exist in counties with majority racial minority populations.
